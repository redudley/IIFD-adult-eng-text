<p>Mrs. Kind is a teacher and her students just finished a coloring book activity.
  After checking her students' work, Mrs. Kind sorted their coloring sheets into a nice, neat pile.
  But her cat Cookie jumped on top of the pile and made a total mess of the worksheets!
  Mrs. Kind needs help to organize the worksheets before she can return them to her students.
  Can you help her to figure out which worksheet belongs to which student? </p>
